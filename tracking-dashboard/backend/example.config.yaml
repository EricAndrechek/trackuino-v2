    # this is disabled by default and we try to do everything independently from APRS-IS,
    # especially if you have more than one or two trackers total, including chase vehicle, 
    # and their upload frequency is higher than once every minute or so
    # in conjunction to keeping this disabled (unless you will not be able to rely on your own
    # ground stations to pick up your trackers), you should also broadcast on a non-standard
    # frequency to avoid flooding the APRS network

        # as the APRS-IS servers are public, you can pull from them without a callsign
        # however, as high traffic can flood the APRS network, if you have many trackers
        # it is advised you broadcast on a non-standard frequency and do everything independently
        # from APRS-IS. as such, this is disabled by default
