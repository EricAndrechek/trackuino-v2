# Tracking Dashboard

This is an open-source application to either pull data from APRS-IS or from your own database and API endpoint for tracking your balloons and vehicles.

This requires a server to host this webpage and a server of data-points.

Additionally, this tool assumes your ground stations were set up using Cloudflare Tunnels
